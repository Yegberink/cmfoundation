The Maastricht Academy of Music has set up the Conservatorium Maastricht Foundation (CMF) along with a number of music lovers in order to raise funds to support talented students at the Academy who find themselves in financial difficulty. Finances The funds available to the CMF mean that it can provide a limited number of talented students with financial aid to help them offset their study costs, the purchase of an instrument, or attendance at master classes and competitions in the Netherlands and abroad. Aid is only provided, of course, if the students concerned do not already have sufficient financial resources. Applications and selection Students who wish to apply for financial aid from the CMF must fill in the appropriate application form.

Application is possible twice a year:
First round: You can apply from August till mid-November. You will receive the result (and possible scholarship) in January.
Second round: You can apply from January till mid-April. You will receive the result (and possible scholarship) after October 1st of the following academic year.
