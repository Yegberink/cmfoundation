The Conservatorium Maastricht Foundation has provided me with the opportunity to
participate in competitions. I would like to thank you for this support. With the specific
goals and deadlines, motivating me to work hard to achieve
the target, I've been able to grow both technically and artistically, pushing me to reach
higher levels. This fund has truly been a cornerstone in my progress, shaping me into a
more confident and skilled musician.

I’ll always be grateful for the financial help I received from the Conservatorium Maastricht
Foundation. One of the financial obstacles for me lied in study-related equipment. With the kind help
of CMF I was able to purchase a new violin bow and greatly improve my study quality as well as my
artistic evolution. Thanks to this, I could sharpen my judgement of musical outcome, enjoy playing in
ensembles even more and finally manage to get a better understanding of sound, as well as what
one looks for in it. I consider myself lucky to have received such a kind help from a wonderful
foundation that listens to the students’ needs and helps them overcome their limitations in order to
fulfill their dreams.
