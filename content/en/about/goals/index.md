The Conservatorium Maastricht Foundation is a foundation that
aims to financially support students of Conservatorium
Maastricht. We focus on very talented music students, with
limited financial resources, from the Classical, jazz and Music
in Education departments.
Through a clearly defined application, which is unmistakably
related to musical development, we support students in the
following ways, among others:

- contribution purchase of new instrument;
- attending international master classes;
- maintenance of instruments.

A contribution to tuition fees can also be requested.
We want to help students who have limited financial resources
in their musical development.
Thanks to the warm contributions of sympathizers, this
foundation can help students finance their studies at
Conservatorium Maastricht.
