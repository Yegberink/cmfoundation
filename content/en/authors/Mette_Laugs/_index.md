Mette Laugs studied Bassoon with Johan Steinmann at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague and obtained her Music Performance degree in 1994. Even before graduating, she joined ‘Het Gelders Orkest’ as co-principal bassoon, being appointed solo bassoon with the orchestra in 1998. For Mette, music is all about connecting, communicating and inspiring. With her characteristic energy and passion, she has been teaching since her youth.
She taught Bassoon as a main subject and Chamber Music at the Prince Claus Conservatoire in Groningen from 2008, and was appointed coordinator of their Master of Music programme in September 2013.
In addition, she completed the Master's programme in Management and Innovation in Social Institutions at HAN University of Applied Sciences in 2015, training as a Change Manager.

She was appointed Head of Programme Classical at Conservatorium Maastricht in mid-August 2021. In that capacity, she hopes to contribute to training the musicians of the future.
