For nearly 30 years I was conductor of both chorus and orchestra of the "Royal Opera of Liège" in Belgium.
During this long period I was given the opportunity to build up a substantial and varied musical repertoire, including opera, operetta, musicals, choirworks, symphonic concerts and Belcanto-concerts with a big choir, orchestra and soloists.

While being engaged by the Opera, I was frequently requested to work as a guest conductor, a.o. at the Opera-Houses of Rouen, Toulon, Vichy, Ghent, Antwerp, Brussels, Amsterdam,Rotterdam,Eindhoven, Heerlen, Maastricht, Aachen and Paris ( where the musical "Singin' in the Rain" received a " Molière" for best musical)

Furthermore, I was frequently invited to conduct at the Opera Festival of Santa Cruz on Tenerife directing Otello, Rigoletto, Ballo in Maschera, La Traviata, Tosca, to name but a few.
I also recorded CDs, such as the world première of the "Symphonie des Ages" by Luc Baiwir, a Belgian composer.

During the "Music Days of Eys 2011 " I conducted the Coronation Mass of Mozart on Sunday the 26th of June 2011 with Nelly Miricioiu and members of the "Limburg Symphony Orchestra"

Also I am very interested in educational projects to pass the richness of music to young people.
I conducted for youngsters:

Oliver Knussen: Where the wild things are,
Mozart: The Magic Flute
Janacek:The Cunning Little Vixen
La Cuisine du Chef
