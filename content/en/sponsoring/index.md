  <strong>Become a friend from €50 per year to support our students; <br> They will be eternally grateful!</strong> <br> <br>
</div>

Our students can apply twice a year to Conservatorium Maastricht
Foundation for financial support.
What kind of applications do we receive?
- A contribution towards the purchase of a new instrument or a bow,
for example.
- A contribution for attending international master classes
- A contribution towards tuition fees because the fees for non-EU
students are very high.
- A contribution to the maintenance of the instrument
