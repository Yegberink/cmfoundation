**What can you do to help us?**

Lovers contribute financial support for (international) projects, world-renowned masterclasses, instrument maintenance and 'first-aid kits' for students in need.
You can help in numerous ways, as you can do a donation of your choice or contribute in other ways than with financial support. It is also possible to be a Platinum, Gold or Silver Lover. Naturally, those wonderful contributions do not go unrewarded. These are unique opportunities, to meet talented musicians at an early stage, follow them and witness their development.
