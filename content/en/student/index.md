Conservatorium Maastricht has set up the Conservatorium
Maastricht Foundation (CMF) along with a number of music lovers
in order to raise funds to support talented students at the
conservatoire who find themselves in financial difficulty. The funds
available to the CMF mean that it can provide a limited number of
talented students with financial aid to help them offset their college
fee, the purchase or maintanance of an instrument, or attendance a
master class and competition in the Netherlands and abroad. Aid is
only provided, of course, if the students concerned do not already
